# SASxport
mirror of SASxport as no longer maintained on CRAN

[As of June 9th 2015, CRAN removed SASxport](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SASxport/index.html) so this is a mirror


It can be installed via 

```
devtools::install_github("dpastoor/SASxport")
```

As I have not gone through the code myself I doubt I could debug (at least the C components), however I will attempt to make sure 
the package continues to build with newer versions of R
